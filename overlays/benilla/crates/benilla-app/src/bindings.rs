//! Key bindings: the one chord-to-command engine every rebindable input runs through. The table
//! lives engine-side ([`benilla_ui::script::keybind`], which the Key Bindings window's Lua edits);
//! this module derives an exact-match dispatch map from it whenever its generation moves.
//!
//! Dispatch ([`latch_and_dispatch`], in [`crate::ui_script::UiInput`] after the UI key feed):
//! - a press probes its exact chord, then once more with its leftmost modifier dropped
//!   ([`Chord::fallback`]); Super held matches nothing;
//! - [`Kind::Held`] commands latch on the press and unlatch on the base key's release (the
//!   reference's `runOnUp` law). UI focus suppresses presses and releases nothing already held;
//!   a latch ends only on its base key's release, the stuck-latch sweep (OS focus loss, the
//!   loading cover) or a VM swap;
//! - [`Kind::Edge`]/[`Kind::EdgeUpDown`] run their 1.12 Lua bodies in the VM;
//! - [`Kind::Host`] lands in [`BindingsState::fired`] for engine consumers.
//!
//! An addon's `Bindings.xml` rows ([`benilla_ui::bindings_xml`]) dispatch here too: a resolved
//! chord names a [`Bound`], either a registry [`Cmd`] or an index into the addon table.
//!
//! While the Keybindings page has a capsule selected (`BenillaBindCapture`), raw input is
//! canonicalized (`ALT-CTRL-SHIFT-<TOKEN>`) and handed to the page, by the 1.12 law: lone
//! modifiers ignored, left and right clicks stay UI clicks, ESC binds like any key.
//!
//! Persistence: `benilla-config/bindings/account.txt` and `<Realm>-<Char>.txt` ([`store`]); the
//! character file's existence is the character-set state, as in the reference.
