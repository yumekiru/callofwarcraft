//! The background networking threads, the socket half of the net bridge.
//!
//! [`spawn_net`]'s read thread parks pre-logon for a [`LoginRequest`], walks logon, realm and
//! world handshake, then parks at character select until the app picks a guid. The pick sends
//! `CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN` and announces the connection without waiting for the verdict, as the
//! reference's world is already loading when it sends the login (`0x46c272`), so the destination's
//! tiles stream a round trip early; a later `SMSG_CHARACTER_LOGIN_FAILED` ends the cycle like a
//! logout ([`Cycle::LoginRefused`]). A stream failure emits
//! [`SessionEvent::Disconnected`] with [`SessionEnd::Lost`] and re-parks. All policy lives in
//! [`crate::login`] and [`crate::char_select`]; this thread only sequences and never sleeps.
//!
//! One long-lived write thread drains [`ClientCommand`](super::ClientCommand)s; each connection
//! hands it the fresh [`WorldWriter`] over a swap channel, so there is only ever one writer.
